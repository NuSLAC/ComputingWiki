You can send a request to the IT desk if you have an Windows account (if you don't have one, [see here](guides/account.md)). 

## Help Desk
Go to [Help Desk Request](https://slacprod.service-now.com/ess/) and log-in with your Windows account. You should see a list of topics to shop around. Some examples below.

* **Want an apple laptop?** Follow the links "hardware" => "Apple Laptop"
* **Want a custom desktop/laptop**? Follow the links "hardware" => "Other Request"
     * This initiate a conversation with a SLAC IT person and you can give your list of preference and they can check whether they can order. I got my custom laptop this way.
* **Want a monitor/accessories?** Same as above: follow the links "hardware" => "Other Request"
     * Just provide the manufacture's webpage showing the item you want.
* **Want a storage space?** Follow the links "Service Catalog" => "Data Backup & Storage"
     * GPFS is a network mounted storage space you can buy at the rate of about $60/TB. The space can be mounted to pretty much any server machine on SLAC network including those participating batch jobs.

For pretty much any of these actions, they all do the same thing: _open a service desk ticket_. Don't be stressed out to find the right links to follow. If you open a ticket under an incorrect category, they will redirect your ticket to the right place. My (personal) habit is to just guess and open a ticket, and let them (service desk) do their job to redirect my ticket!

For any order that comes with some financial cost (such as a hardware purchase, disk space request, etc.), you will need to provide an account number to be charged. If you don't know this yet, open a ticket but in parallel ask your boss what account number to use. The order eventually needs to be approved by your boss, so you won't have to worry about accidentally spending money from the account even if you forget to tell your boss (sorry, that won't work).
