# Guides

This wiki is a reference for how to access and utilize computing resources at SLAC, and is meant for the short/long baseline accelerator neutrino group at SLAC and collaborators.

Experienced members of SLAC neutrino group should actively participate to add more descriptions.
Yes, I am talking to you, Tracy. None of the below addresses your issue/question? You can try to harass kazu.

## Getting started with SLAC computing (for everyone)

You can find the following info on this wiki:

* **Step 1:** [Computing account at SLAC](guides/account.md)
  - What are they? How to get them? What should you do first after getting accounts?

* **Step 2:** [Using the computing resources](guides/resources.md)
  - Gimme GPUs!

## Buying and setting up a laptop/desktop (for SLAC members)

* [Making "I want X"](guides/request.md) request(X = computing related)
  - How can I get my own laptop? a server? disk space for storage? network bandwidth to parallel download 100 movies? (don't)
* [Building/Owning a Desktop](guides/building.md)
  - Still under construction. Your help/experience needed!

## ICARUS Computing Cookbook

* [ICARUS production](icarus/production.md) aka Making simulation samples
* (older version) Instructions to setup and produce ICARUS data
