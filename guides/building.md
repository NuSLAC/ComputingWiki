**This article is to be documented!**

Some notes below:

* Making a parts-list with compatibility checks: [my past example](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Cmghm8)
* Computing hardwares need to be on [EPEAP registry](https://ww2.epeat.net/searchoptions.aspx) to be purchased with DOE money
    * Stanford account can be used to purchase anything!
* "Owning" a laptop/desktop
    * **What's "not owning"?** SLAC IT will set up BIOS and govern your OS to ensure the security and maintenance, to the level that you need them to intervene you to reinstall/upgrade OS, etc.. This, to me, means I don't have enough freedom and I feel not owning a machine. **This is needed to connect your machine to SLAC network**.
    * **How to avoid?** You can install Linux and claim you won't need their support. Now you have full freedom to upgrade/reinstall your OS, configure file system and go insane and mess up with your life. **However you won't be able to use SLAC network.** Fortunately, either `visitor` or `eduroam` are fast enough IMO.
    * **To do**: can I set up a ssh log-in without being on SLAC? In principle not possible but in practice there might be a solution.
