## Three accounts (ugh!)

There are three types of accounts: 
* **Scientific User (USER)** account
  * needed for all SLAC employees and users. You need this before applying for a computing account.
* **Computing (Unix/Windows)** account
  * for all practical things including use of computing resources. You need this before applying for a S3DF account.
* **S3DF** account
  * for accessing S3DF computing facility, where you would do research computing.

## Requesting a USER account
1. Go to [this page](https://vue.slac.stanford.edu/ufva). 
2. Choose SCIENTIFIC USER
3. Click on BEFORE YOU ARRIVE, expand the field and LAUNCH SCIENTIFIC USER FORM.
4. Let them know who they should choose for the Point of Contact (POC, e.g. Kazuhiro Terao, Hirohisa Tanaka, Mark Convery)

**After the submission**...
* Contact your POC about the submission of your application.

## Requesting a computing account
Once your USER account is approved, you should receive an email notifying that and your "system ID" which consists of 6 digits. Contact [Kazu](mailto:kterao@slac.stanford.edu) with following information:
  * Your system ID
  * Name of your home institution
  * **TWO** preferred unix user account name to be created for you, in the order of preference. Your account name may contain digits 0-9, lower-case letters a-z, and the special character "-". Must begin with a lower-case letter a-z. Must not be shorter than 3 or longer than 8 characters.

Once your account is granted, make sure you complete the cyber security training.
Otherwise your account will be disabled very soon.

## S3DF computing account
Once you have your Unix computing account:
* Go to [this page](https://coact.slac.stanford.edu/)
* Click "Login..." and enter your Unix account name and password.
* With correct username and password, this process will generate a request to enable your computing account for S3DF. Notify [Kazu](mailto:kterao@slac.stanford.edu) so he will approve. He gets a notice automatically from your request so if you trust the process (what?), you don't have to nudge him.

## Tips related to your computing account
* Note useful links related to computing:
    * Set up CISCO DUO authentification. [Download DUO app](https://duo.com/product/multi-factor-authentication-mfa/duo-mobile-app) and [register your DUO](https://www-internal.slac.stanford.edu/twostep/enrollment) for use at slac. 
    * Use [SLAC IT Service desk](https://slacprod.servicenowservices.com/it_services/) to submit tickets and let the IT team know any tiny issue you experience.
    * Join SLAC slack workspace to communicate with your teammates and SLAC IT experts. If you are an employee, use SUNet ID to log into [slac.slack.com](https://slac.slack.com) workspace.
    * Use VPN to make your connection not only secure but also stable to SLAC network. The address is [vpn.slac.stanford.edu](https://vpn.slac.stanford.edu). Here's an [instruction](https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/display/NetMan/How+to+Connect+to+SLAC+VPN) provided by the SLAC IT.
    * If you are a student/employee of Stanford/SLAC, Stanford provides a personal webspace to host your website. Instructions are [here](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/web/centralhosting/howto_user).
