# SLUO account request
SLAC User Organization (SLUO) account needs to be created before using the lab resources at SLAC including computing facilities. Once you have a SLUO account, you can request a computing account.

## How to request an account
Go to [SLUO webpage](https://www-group.slac.stanford.edu/sluo/) and follow the hyperlink "SLUO User Information Form" to submit your request. Contact [Kazu](mailto:kterao@slac.stanford.edu) or your SLAC collaborator supporting the process and tell that you submitted a request.

## Tips on filling the request form
You can use your best guess on all questions asked in the account request form. Mistakes can be corrected later. Of course, avoiding a mistake will hopefully endup a smoother approval process. So here is some tips on filling the request form.

**On the 1st page**, in case followings are unclear...
*  For "Will you be using any SLAC computing resources", choose "Yes"
*  For "Experiment you will be working on", you can choose "Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment"

**Then on the 2nd page**...
*  For "**SLAC Spokesperson/Sponsor/Supervisor** ...", "Kazuhiro Terao"
*  The section "**NON US CITIZENS**", you don't have to enter anything unless you have US visa. No worries, though there's asterisk, it does not mean it is required. If you do have visa, fill all fields. If you don't, do not fill any field in this section. 
*  For "**Starting Date**", please enter today's date
*  For "**SLAC Deapartment**", please choose "EPP Neutrino"
*  For "**Funding Source**", please choose "DOE"
*  For "**How long will you**...", please choose "FIXED TERM", then set the starting date today to 1 year
*  For "**What percent of time**...", please choose "<10%" unless you work at SLAC.

**After the submission**...
*  You may be asked to submit a CV listing your education (from college onwards) and employment record. Please note this cannot have >=1 year gap in the record since the college graduation. This is not for a job application and your employement history and education records are all what matters :)
* Contact [Kazu](mailto:kterao@slac.stanford.edu) or any SLAC contact who is supporting your application.
